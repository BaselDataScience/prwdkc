Description: Parametrized Random Walk Diffusion Kernel Clustering (P-RWDKC),
    is suitable for handling both directed and undirected graphs.
    The framework is based on diffusion geometry and 
    the generalized spectral clustering framework. The 
    algorithm automatically reveals the cluster structure at a given 
    scale by considering the random walk dynamics associated with a 
    parametrized kernel operator, and by estimating its critical diffusion 
    time. For details see https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.00310.
